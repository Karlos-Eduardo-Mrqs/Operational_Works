## About Module Python

This module contains the resolution of several problems and projects developed in Python, organized according to complexity and concepts used. The structure is divided into two large sections: **Resolution_Problems** and **Work_With_Classes**.

---

## [📁 Resolution_Problems](./resolution_problems/README.md)

Contains exercises focused on basic programming logic and the initial use of functions.

### 📂 [Simple_Problems](./resolution_problems/simple_problems/)

Easy problems that use basic logic, conditional structures, and loops. Ideal for those who are just starting out with Python.

### 📂 [Problems_With_Functions](./resolution_problems/functions_problems/)

Exercises that explore the use of **functions** to improve code structure and promote reuse. An introduction to program modularization.

---

## [📁 Work_With_Classes](./works_with_classes/README.md)

Focused on the application of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, with the use of **classes** and objects to solve more elaborate problems.

### 📂 [Normal_Problems](./works_with_classes/normal_problems/)

Problems solved with classes in a simple way, focusing on understanding the basic concepts of object orientation in Python.

### 📂 [Problem_Solving](./works_with_classes/projects_resolutions/)

More elaborate projects using classes, which may include **simulations**, **small systems** or **task automation**. These are practical examples that apply the concepts learned in a more complete way.

---

> 📌 **General Objective:** To provide a collection of solutions for different levels of proficiency in Python, from the first steps with logic to applications with OOP.

🧠 **Difficulty level:**  *Basic → Intermediate*
