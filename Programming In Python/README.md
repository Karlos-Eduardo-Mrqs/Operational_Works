## [üìÅ Resolution_Problems](https://github.com/Karlos-Eduardo-Mrqs/Operational_Works/tree/main/Programming%20In%20Python/resolution_problems)

Contains exercises focused on basic programming logic and the initial use of functions.

### üìÇ [Simple_Problems](https://github.com/Karlos-Eduardo-Mrqs/Operational_Works/tree/main/Programming%20In%20Python/resolution_problems/simple_problems)

Easy problems that use basic logic, conditional structures, and loops. Ideal for those who are just starting out with Python.

### üìÇ [Problems_With_Functions](https://github.com/Karlos-Eduardo-Mrqs/Operational_Works/tree/main/Programming%20In%20Python/resolution_problems/functions_problems)

Exercises that explore the use of **functions** to improve code structure and promote reuse. An introduction to program modularization.

---

## [üìÅ Work_With_Classes](https://github.com/Karlos-Eduardo-Mrqs/Operational_Works/tree/main/Programming%20In%20Python/works_with_classes)

Focused on the application of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, with the use of **classes** and objects to solve more elaborate problems.


### üìÇ [Normal_Problems](https://github.com/Karlos-Eduardo-Mrqs/Operational_Works/tree/main/Programming%20In%20Python/works_with_classes/normal_problems)

Problems solved with classes in a simple way, focusing on understanding the basic concepts of object orientation in Python.

### üìÇ [Problem_Solving](https://github.com/Karlos-Eduardo-Mrqs/Operational_Works/tree/main/Programming%20In%20Python/works_with_classes/Projects_Resolutions)

More elaborate projects using classes, which may include **simulations**, **small systems** or **task automation**. These are practical examples that apply the concepts learned in a more complete way.
